* Test and debug

- The -trackMoves option is not working


* Test .NET version
* Test interoperability with .NET version
* Move comments over from .NET and clean up
* Add ability to use manifest prototype by specifying command line option

Doc updates:
For java version, when entering regex for ignore, you must either escape backslashes with double backslash or enclose the string in double quotes
Does this apply when using Mono version from OSX?

TODO:
- install latest Mono on Air and test with rt
- make manifest file check implementation for groom consistent in .NET to what was done with .NET, also do this in doTrackMoves()
